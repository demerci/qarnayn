# Important
1. 01.05.2024    
   i. Adding a Discord section because why not. ðŸ¥°    
   ii. Now using Github Desktop and Intellij to write the website so now I no longer have to make 100 changes. ðŸ˜Ž     
   iii. Changed the name of the website from RUH to QARNAYN      
   iv. ACCIDENTALLY RUINED THE WEBSITE FOR A SOLID 3 MINUTES    
   v. Identified an issue, can't go back once you're in the Quotes section.

# Discord
1. I should probably just send a Discord invite link here.     
  i. And make a whole section in this website about #quotes.     
  ii. and some honourable mentions need to be said. Actually I'll do it âœ¨    

remind me next time to add lorem ipsum placeholder    
- I added a lorem ipsum place holder. ðŸ’ª
