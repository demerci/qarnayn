# QARNAYN: Notes

# Website things
- 01.05.2024    
  i.Adding a Discord section because why not. ðŸ¥°    
  ii. Honestly I shouldn't actually add a disqus chat here.    
  iii. I'm about to add redirects only to [Home](index.md) it's getting a bit too much (unnecessary) work to change EVERY file and release it.    
  iv. about to add an easter egg for Nimari, and our random, bookloving, unseeable visitor that decided to save me one day.     
  v. Now using Github Desktop and Intellij to write the website so now I no longer have to make 100 changes. ðŸ˜Ž     
  vi. Changed the name of the website from RUH to QARNAYN     
  vii. iv. ACCIDENTALLY RUINED THE WEBSITE FOR A SOLID 3 MINUTES


- 30.04.2024    
  i. Honestly I have zero clue what I am doing, but I am doing it!    
  ii. I added NOTES.md here. Thinking of adding some Discord server invite links for zero reason whatsoever.    
  iii. I finally figured out how to format like this so expect to see other areas formated better lol. I should add a chat here maybe disqus or something idk    
  iv. I changed the style of the website, still changing stuff.    
  v. Added [NOTES](NOTES.md), I'll move some things there and keep it like an archive or just say non-important things there. Perhaps Nimari will see it.    
  vi. Working on adding disqus chats here.
